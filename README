# This script is based on an old script from Hale (Emad's group). There are some modifications that allow for better minimization of ring piercings and weird bonds.
# In order to convert HMMM lipids to their full-length forms, run the following script by
# -> sh ./hmmm-to-fl-script.sh
# You will have to include the LongBondEliminator folder (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9856086/) inside of this current one (thank you for this wonderful tool!).
# The script will call the corresponding tcl scripts located in this directory. 
# Be sure not to move these files without changing their paths.
# The toppar contains the charmm parameter and topology files, which are obtained from CHARMM-GUI
# Note that hmmm-to-fl-script.sh, all the tcl scripts, and the toppar folder need to be in the same directory
